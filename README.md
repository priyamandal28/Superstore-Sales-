# Superstore-Sales-POWERBI DASHBOARD AND SALES FORECASTING DATA ANALYTICS
POWERBI Dashboard
Objective:
 The goal of this assignment is to assess your ability to clean and transform data, build meaningful
 visualizations, create an interactive Power BI dashboard, and derive insights that can be used for
 decision-making.
DATASET:
 1. Superstore Sales Dataset:- Order Details: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date- Customer Details: Customer Name, Customer Segment- Product Details: Category, Sub-Category, Product Name- Sales Data: Sales Amount, Profit, Discount, Quantity- Geography: Region, State

TASKS:
 1. Load the dataset into Power BI and ensure correct data types.
 2. Handle missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistencies.
 3. Create the following Power BI visuals:
   - KPI Cards: Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity
   - Line Chart: Monthly sales trends
   - Map: Profit distribution across regions
   - Bar Chart: Top & bottom products by profit
   - Scatter Plot: Impact of discounts on profit margins
 4. Add slicers for Date Range, Region, Customer Segment, and Product Category.

DATA ANALYTICS:
In this assignment, you will work with real-world retail sales data
to develop a forecasting model that predicts future sales for thousands of product families across different stores in Ecuador.

This project will help you understand how external factors like promotions, holidays, economic conditions, and events
impact sales, and how machine learning models can be used to improve demand forecasting.

This assignment is structured into two parts:
1. Data Processing and Feature Engineering (Day 1) - Cleaning, transforming, and exploring the dataset.
2. Model Selection, Forecasting, and Evaluation (Day 2) - Training different forecasting models, comparing their performance,
and presenting insights.
